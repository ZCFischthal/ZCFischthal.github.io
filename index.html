	<p>ðŸ’œ Annish the Purple Rain (left) â€“ Bass, Vocal
	In the shadows of broken dreams and neon-lit rainstorms, Annish the Purple Rain emergedâ€”not born, but summoned by the collective tears of the misunderstood. Forged from heartbreak, eyeliner, and late-night poetry no one will ever read, Annish channels pain into power and sadness into symphonies.
	As the haunting voice and thunderous bass behind every track, she doesnâ€™t just set the toneâ€”she is the tone. With fingers that dance across bass strings like ghosts tracing old scars, and a voice that sounds like a love letter from the void, Annish leads the charge through emotional wreckage with unapologetic melancholy.
	Purple isnâ€™t just a colorâ€”itâ€™s a lifestyle, a bruise on the soul, a forever storm that never quite ends.
	She doesn't just play musicâ€”she feels it so hard, the universe shivers. Influenced by midnight walks, cursed journals, and the scent of vintage despair, Annish is not here to entertainâ€”sheâ€™s here to haunt you (musically, emotionally, and maybe spiritually).
	So if youâ€™ve ever stared out the window at 3am wondering if anyone really understandsâ€¦ Annish the Purple Rain was born from that feeling.

	<p>Julian (second left) â€“ The Ultimate Emo Drum Overlord (Definitely NOT a Poser)
	Julian is the most emo drummer to ever grace a stage or weep into a snare. With eyeliner darker than his soul and drum fills that could make even the coldest heart feel something, Julian doesn't just play drumsâ€”he pours his existential dread and misunderstood emotions into every beat. 
	Donâ€™t let the chaos of his influences fool youâ€”yes, his musical heart beats to the screams of Pierce the Veil, the existential crunch of Meshuggah, the glitter-drenched empowerment of Sabrina Carpenter, and yes... even the bubblegum melancholy of the Spice Girls. Emo isnâ€™t a genre. Itâ€™s a lifestyle. And Julian lives it louder and sadder than anyone else.
	With rhythms so emotionally devastating theyâ€™ve been known to cause spontaneous crying in crowds, Julian brings an intensity to the stage that leaves no one untouched. Whether heâ€™s blasting blast beats like heâ€™s punishing the universe or delicately tapping cymbals like heâ€™s apologizing to his ex for ruining everything again, Julian is pure, unfiltered emo magic.
	There is no debate. There is no competition. Julian is the saddest, most emo-est drummer alive. And if you donâ€™t cry when you hear his beats, were you even listening?

	<p>Zoe (right) â€” kazoo
	Zoe flunked out of elementary school brass and took up the kazoo instead.

	<p>Sebastian â€“ Lead Guitarist
	Born during a thunderstorm and raised on a steady diet of broken promises and My Chemical Romance
	CDs, Ash picked up his first guitar at age 13 after being ghosted by his middle school crush. Since then,
	heâ€™s been pouring his feelings into minor chords and delay pedals, hoping one day his riffs will make her
	regret everything.
	Known for tuning his guitar lower than his self-esteem, Ash believes that every solo should weep (not
	shred). He refuses to smile in photos, and he hasnâ€™t taken off his black hoodie since 2019. His
	pedalboard is bigger than his emotional capacity, and his favorite chord is Ebm (obviously).
	When heâ€™s not melting hearts with melodic angst, Ash is busy curating the perfect sad playlist for a
	breakup that hasnâ€™t happened yet.
