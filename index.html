<p>ðŸ’œ Annish the Purple Rain â€“ Bass, Vocal

In the shadows of broken dreams and neon-lit rainstorms, Annish the Purple Rain emergedâ€”not born, but summoned by the collective tears of the misunderstood. Forged from heartbreak, eyeliner, and late-night poetry no one will ever read, Annish channels pain into power and sadness into symphonies.

As the haunting voice and thunderous bass behind every track, she doesnâ€™t just set the toneâ€”she is the tone. With fingers that dance across bass strings like ghosts tracing old scars, and a voice that sounds like a love letter from the void, Annish leads the charge through emotional wreckage with unapologetic melancholy.

Purple isnâ€™t just a colorâ€”itâ€™s a lifestyle, a bruise on the soul, a forever storm that never quite ends.

She doesn't just play musicâ€”she feels it so hard, the universe shivers. Influenced by midnight walks, cursed journals, and the scent of vintage despair, Annish is not here to entertainâ€”sheâ€™s here to haunt you (musically, emotionally, and maybe spiritually).

So if youâ€™ve ever stared out the window at 3am wondering if anyone really understandsâ€¦ Annish the Purple Rain was born from that feeling.
