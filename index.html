		<p>Forged in the depths of heartbreak, thrift store leather, and the leftover eyeliner of the 2000s, Finding Emo is the sonic equivalent of a glittery breakdown in a Hot Topic dressing room. From left to right, they are chaos incarnate â€” a five-piece emotional avalanche hellbent on making sure you cry before they do. 
		Born from heartbreak, overprocessed vocals, and one too many late-night AIM conversations, this group of beautifully damaged souls has turned sadness into an aesthetic, and minor keys into a mission. Though their journey began with five members, tragedy struck when lead singer Blake Veinshadow attempted to stage dive into an audience that was too emotionally overwhelmed to catch him. He ascended directly into the emo afterlife.
